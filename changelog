id2xml (1.5.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Fixed a few Python 3.x nits in the parser code.

  * Changed generated anchor slugs so as to not collide with IDs used by 
    xml2rfc, which in v3 mode reserves certain prefixes used for section, 
    figure and table anchors and fragment identifiers.  Also fixed an xml2rfc 
    v2v3 convertere compatibility issue.

  * Added outdent to id2xml progress statements in order to more clearly 
    differentiate them from warnings and errors.

  * Added the possibility of setting document stream, IPR, and consensus 
    values with switches instead of deriving them from the 'Status of this 
    Memo' section, to make processing of documents with old status wording 
    easier.

  * Added a list of valid submission types and stream names to id2xml.utils.

  * Tweaked several command-line options to better match those of xml2rfc.  
    Added help for trace options when --help is given together with --debug.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Sep 2019 12:30:14 +0000


id2xml (1.4.4) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Since '--' isn't allowed inside html comments, trying to add a comment 
    that contains that string will fail.  Under some circumstances, id2xml
    inserts comments about conversion errors into the generated xml, and
    if the failed text contained '--', this would fail.  Tweaked comment
    insertion to avoid this.

  * Added code to look for Abstract both before and after Status-of-Memo 
    and Copyright sections.  The placement of the Abstract changes around the 
    time of RFC 5550.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  17 Oct 2018 12:10:41 +0000

id2xml (1.4.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Fixed some issues with author recognition and an infinite loop.

  * Added handling for the grammar change 'a candidate' --> 'candidates' in 
    the status of memo boilerplate.

  * Aligned the short options for verbose and version with common practice.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  12 Oct 2018 14:05:46 +0000


id2xml (1.4.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Fixed a couple of issues that prevented processing of rfc7752.

  * Aligned generator comment date format with that used by xml2rfc

  * Added a 'Generated by' comment showing id2xml version and time of run.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Jul 2018 14:33:25 +0000


id2xml (1.4.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release which provides 2 small enhancements:

  * Deal better with comma-separated lists of rfc numbers in Updates: and 
    Obsoletes: fields in the input document header.

  * Added warnings as comments inline in the xml file (in addition to 
    showing them on stderr).

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Dec 2017 22:39:48 +0000

id2xml (1.4.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a small feature release which adds support for tables with
  style='all'.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  02 Nov 2017 18:06:11 +0000


id2xml (1.3.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Added http:/https: normalization when comparing boilerplate.  Also 
    tweaked punctuation in some warning messages, for consistency.  Permitted 
    some additional variation in appendix section numbering.

  * Added a new test document, containing https:// boilerplate URLs.

  * Added Glen and Matt @amsl.com to the release-mail recipients.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  30 Oct 2017 13:10:19 +0000


id2xml (1.3.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release adds a --schema-v3 switch, which will cause id2xml to generate
  xml according to xml2rfc vocabulary vesion 3.  Earlier it was indicated that
  this would be available with version 2.0.0 of id2xml, but the v3 generation
  was accomplished with much less of a rewrite than anticipated, and the v2
  output is still the default, so a major version bump seems inappropriate.

  Details from the commit log:

  * Changed a dependency from pathlib to the recommended replacement 
    pathlib2, and added a version requirement to the xml2rfc dependency.

  * Added support for id2xml conversion to xml2rfc vocabulary version 3 
    format by using the v2v3 conversion component of xml2rfc.  This is invoked 
    with a new switch: -3 / --schema-v3.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  23 Sep 2017 15:47:13 +0000


id2xml (1.2.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Added support for using draft names in references to identify 
    references that may have bibxml entries, and use those.  If found, update 
    the xref targets in the document accordingly.  Updated baseline diffs.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  23 Sep 2017 12:27:53 +0000

id2xml (1.2.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Added a warning when an author name is seen in the document title 
    abbreviation.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  10 Aug 2017 15:09:39 +0000


id2xml (1.2.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Fixed a bug in the handling of unnumbered reference sections.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  10 Aug 2017 11:59:24 +0000


id2xml (1.2.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a small feature release which adds some variations to the recognised
  title of the copyright section.  There's also a small bugfix:

  * Added recognition of additional variations on the title of the 
    copyright section, based on common variations received from the RFC Editor.

  * Fixed a bug in the handling of docname parts in reference text, when 
    the docname cannot be split into series info.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  09 Aug 2017 18:52:16 +0000


id2xml (1.1.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release provides minor changes in response to feedback from the
  RFC Editor staff.

  * Added space normalization when checking / skipping boilerplate text.

  * Added support for using reference anchors to identify references that 
    may have bibxml entries, including W3C, IEEE and 3GPP references.  Tweaked 
    the reference organization pattern.  Some refactoring.

  * Tweaked the help text for trace switches.

  * Removed the dependency on pyterminalsize, but will use it if installed.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  27 Jul 2017 12:42:01 +0000


id2xml (1.0.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release tweaks some regular expressions and other items to improve
  processing, based on feedback from the RFC Editor staff, but does not
  provide any new functionality.

  * Added recognition of series info of the form 'RFC1234' in addition to 
    the form 'RFC 12334'.  Added recognition of 'Internet Draft' on the first 
    page left column, in addition to 'Internet-Draft'.  Added some guidance to 
    the reference parsing failure message.  Added another reference pattern.

  * Tweaked the section number regexp.

  * Added acceptance of day of month in footer line date.  This improves 
    extraction of short title, too.

  * Be more permissive regarding blank lines in the author address format.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Jul 2017 21:34:21 +0000

id2xml (1.0.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a bugfix release which addressess some additional issues raised by
  the RFC Editor staff:

  * Set the full organization name in the author element from the 
    information in the authors' addresses section, and using what was found on 
    the first page, if different, as the abbrev attribute.

  * Changed the handling of quotations of RFCs with numbers below 1000 to
    always use zero-padded numbers, to match what the bibxml libraries use;
    and to insert entity references for those, instead of in-place
    <reference/> entries.  Fixes an issues reported by the RFC-Editor staff.

  * Changed text-table identification to not try to handle one-row tables as
    texttables.  Fixes an issues reported by the RFC-Editor staff.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  18 Jun 2017 20:33:34 +0000

id2xml (1.0.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a bugfix release which addressess a number of issues raised by the
  RFC Editor staff, and a few issues found during testing.

  * Added generation of a sortrefs PI which matches the original's RFC
    references being sorted or not.

  * Tweaked the slugifier, and applied it to section-* anchors, to ensure 
    they are valid.  Fixed an issue causing trailing commas in entity names.

  * Rewrote the handling of back matter to permit the various back sections 
    to occur in any order.  Added yet another way to say 'work in progress' in 
    references; added new reference patterns and removed the expectation that 
    references will have a terminating period; did some minor code clean-up.

  * Refined the header and footer stripping to consider end-of-line commas,
    and to require short lines triggering paragraph breaks to contain text.

  * Fixed a bug in line reading, which could cause the first line of a 
    document to be skipped.  Added recognition of additional Standards Track 
    status indications, such as 'Proposed Standard', etc.  Fixed a grammar 
    issue.  Fixed an issue with mismatched authors on the first page and 
    Author's Addresses section.  Refined the header/footer stripping to deal 
    with additional variations of header/footer lines.

  * Fixed a number of places where warn() was called with a line object
    instead of the line number.

  * Changed to using the supplied figure or texttable label to set the 
    title attribute also when rendering the figure as texttable or texttable as 
    figure.

  * Refined the tokenizer for the text parser in order to correctly handle 
    things like (Section N.N).

  * Eliminated trailing blank cells in texttables.

  * Added RFC-Editor staff to the release notification list.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  14 Jun 2017 12:22:54 +0000


id2xml (1.0.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  The number of lines in the corpus of test documents now show a percentage
  of lines which differ from the original input file to the text file generated
  from id2xml's xml file of just over 2%, and in some cases the generated
  text is an improvement over the original text.  The tool should now be
  functionally complete for vocabulary v2 output, so this seems like a good
  time for a 1.0.0 release.

  Changes since 1.0.0rc3:

  * Split the functionality up into separate run.py, parser.py and utils.py
    files, and adjusted Makefile and MANIFEST accordingly.

  * Entries in the <references/> sections are now entity references for drafts
    and RFCs, instead of inserting the reference xml as generated from the
    input document.

  * There's a slight refactoring of how the reference_anchors and
    section_anchors lists are generated.

  * Added xref elements for Section N.nn strings which reference document
    sections.

  * There has been multiple rounds of refactoring, to clean up and organise
    the code better.

  * The generated xml has also been cleaned up, to avoid long lines and
    tags bunched up on the same line.  It's still not super pretty, but
    should be readable.

  * Added a check on coupled debug trace switches, where setting a trace start
    option also requires that a trace stop option be set.

  * The regular expression which identifies code has been further refined.

  * Refined the header stripping to not join pararaphs where the first part
    has a short line.

  * Added more cases where list hangIndent is derived and set.

  * Added modification of the text-list-symbols PI in order to better match
    the source.  Since this is a global setting, it can't handle inconsistent
    bullet styles in a document (for instance created with hangText="*" ...).

  * Improved the error message for missing stream information when attempting
    to process older RFCs

  * Fixed a bug in the handling of the xml tree for xrefs found in text
    interspersed with vspace elements.

  * Code optimisations.

  * Added the last two changelog sections to the release information shown onl
    PyPi.

id2xml (1.0.0rc3) ietf; urgency=low

  This release reduces the diff between the text input file and the
  text file resulting from the generated xml even more.  The average
  number of lines in the input which is rendered differently in the
  output is now below 3%.

  From the changelog:

  * Committed updated (smaller) diff files for test baseline

  * Added more alternatives to the code recognition regex, for xml tags and
    C statements

  * Refined the header/footer stripping a bit, to not join text broken across
    pages into one paragraph when there are too many intervening blank lines, 
    or when the last line is a table or figure label.

  * Added handling of blank lines in list items, by inserting <vspace> as
    needed

  * Added isertion of subcompact PIs for compact list.  Fixed some warning 
    message issues.

  * Added another comment delimiter to the code regex, and applied it to
    whole text blocks, not only to their first line.

  * Moved list block normalisation functions into the DraftParser class, and
    added recognition of compact lists.  Also some refactoring.

  * Added more descriptive manpage text, and tweaked the making of the
    manpage.

  * Added switches for trace start and stop on line number, and renamed the
    trace-related switches.

  * Refined guess_list_style().

  * Added code to recognise 'centered' titles when they span the whole line

  * Rewrote the code which parses the top left column of the titlepage to not
    assume any ordering of the lines, but permit them to occur in almost any
    order.  The only exception is that if there's a working group string, it
    must occur first, as it has no recognizable keyword to identify it.

id2xml (1.0.0rc2) ietf; urgency=low

  * Tweaked the help text and the manpage generation.

  * Updated MANIFEST and Makefile

  * Added some missing files, updated the acceptable diffs in test/ok/.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  22 May 2017 22:38:41 +0200


id2xml (1.0.0-rc1) ietf; urgency=low

  * Improved the debug trace facilities with --start-trace on a text match,
    --stop-trace on a text match, and --trace one or more function names

  * Improved the code recognition regex, in order to handle more code and
    constants fragments as figures.

  * Added recognition and handling of <CODE BEGINS> and <CODE ENDS> marks

  * Added recognition of reference text date strings containing days

  * Added recognition of another usage of 'Work-in-progress' in references

  * Modified list handling to recognise lists in additional formats, and to
    use <vspace> to introduce line breaks and blank lines for some cases

  * Added recognition of reference quotes within list text

  * Added 2 new ways to recognize text which needs to be captured as figures
    (based on recurring wide whitespace and on text not being paragraph filled)

  * Added better handling of draft references for the purpose of generating
    proper entity definitions in the doctype declaration

  * Refined the test suite to show percentages of lines which deviate between
    text master and the text generated from the generated xml, and to not
    include differences in the ToC page numbers in the checked diff
    linecounts.

  * Added support for title abbreviation occuring in the footer, rather 
    than the header.  Explicitly created a title abbreviation for long titles 
    with no abbreviation available, rather than letting xml2rfc mangle the page 
    header.

  * Tweaked the setup to make the local debug.py available.

  * Don't interpret 'Internet-Draft' at the top left of the first page as a 
    workgroup name.  Test case added.

  * Added list default style 'empty', based on an issue report from 
    julian.reschke@gmx.de

  * Added stripping of leading/trailing blanks from author name components 
    (initials and surname), based on an issue report from julian.reschke@gmx.de

  * Renamed the subversion branch to match the selected tool name.

    cleaned up the repository content.  Bumped the version.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  15 May 2017 22:17:20 +0000

id2xml (0.9.2) ietf; urgency=low

  This pre-release fixes additional issues reported by rjsparks@nostrum.com
  during initial testing.  From the changelog:

  * Added makefile rules to make diff comparison tests between original and 
    generated .txt files, and some baseline diffs.

  * Tweaked script message formatting slightly

  * Added some config default values.  Tweaked the command-line switches.  
    Generalized the handling of recognized non-numbered section names, 
    including some code refactoring and simplification.  Added recognition of 
    additional reference formats in the reference sections.  Added debug output 
    methods which can be selectively switched on or off, per parser entity 
    function, from the command line; with some related refactoring of the 
    options handling.

  * Added support for .id2xmlrc config files.  Added support for 
    symrefs='no'.  Fixed a bug which could cause a divide-by-zero error.  Added 
    --debug and --quiet options.  Changed conversion error messages to only 
    show traceback when --debug is set.  Added handling of Figure and Table 
    titles that only number the figure/table, without providing a title text.

  * Added some fixes for older documents, and documents with many authors.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  15 May 2017 00:22:56 +0200

id2xml (0.9.1) ietf; urgency=low

  This pre-release fixes some issues reported by rjsparks@nostrum.com
  during initial testing, and by housley@vigilsec.com during text review:

  * Fixed some issues found for draft-sparks-genarea-review-tracker-03.txt: 
    Use of 'Work in Progress' annotation for non-draft references, code/figure 
    text indented less than 3 spaces.

  * Fixed a number of issues found for rfc7842: Use of None instead of 
    blank string as null input to skip(); failed to accept spelling 
    'acknowledgment', failed to set attribute 'numbered' to 'no' for back 
    matter sections which were not numbered.

  * Updated readme based on feedback from housley@vigilsec.com

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  10 May 2017 21:12:28 +0200

id2xml (0.9.0) ietf; urgency=low

  This is the first public release.  Recent changes:

  * New readme text, more appropriate as pypi description.

  * Increased the version number before pre-release, and added an upload: 
    target to the makefile.

  * Fixed an issue with identifying URIs sections, and tweaked the symbol 
    ratio limit between figures and t/list items.

  * Rearranged id2xml as a package instead of as a single-file module, in 
    order to be able to enclose the v2 and v3 .rnc and .rng files (and possibly 
    other data files in the future).  Added LICENCE, README and MANIFEST files. 

  * Changed argument parsing to use argparse, and changed the Makefile to 
    process the new help text into something txt2man can use to produce a 
    manpage.

  * Removed the local command-line script

  * Moved the bulk of the command-line invocation code from id2xml to 
    id2xml.run(), in order to support general setuptools script installation.  
    Added recognition of 'URIs' sections generated from erefs.  Added a 
    setup.py file and other supporting files to enable pip and setuptools 
    installation.

  * Added a guard against overwriting what could be the xml file.  Added 
    wrapping of warning and error messages.

  * Added -o (output file) and -p (output path) options to the invocation 
    script, and tweaked the --help output.

  * Fixed an issue with identification of sublists to lists, an issue with 
    joining some URLs broken across lines, and an issue with wrong column 
    settings when extracting table columns.

  * Improved eref support, some refactoring.

  * Added processing of erefs and xrefs to reference entries.

  * Stable point: parsing front, back, and sections in place; generated xml 
    produces text that matches original well when run through xml2rfc.  Major 
    missing piece: parsing of text paragraphs to provide xref elements.
